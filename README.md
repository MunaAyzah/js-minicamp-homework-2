1. Feynman Writing Prompts - Write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.
		
	* for loop
	* && || !
	* Array
	* git
	* GitHub


Answers:
1. For loop:  
     When you need to call something again and again we use for loop. We need to initialize the for loop, it checks for the condition and then increments the number until it the ends the condition.
 Syntax: for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement operation);
Example: for (var I = 0; I<= 10; i++)
I is initialized to 0 once it meets the condition it gives the result and increments the I value and continues the loop until the condition becomes false.
2.  && ||! :
     Above symbols are logical operator. For example consider 0 and 1.
&& (AND operator): If the value is 0 && 1 and 1 && 0, the result is 0. Similarly 0 && 0 and 1 && 1, the result is 1.
| | (OR operator): If the value is 0 | | 1, 1 | | 0 , 1 | | 1, the result is 1. Similarly 0 | | 0.
! (Not Operator): is defined as not equal to operator.
 3. Array : Array is similar to variable but can hold multiple data in rows and columns. 
Syntax: ArrayName[ variable name]= {data1,data 2….}
Example: arr[3]= {arr[0],arr[1],arr[2]};
Note: Array starts with zero.
4. GIT : is version system control software. It is used for adding ,deleting and deleting the file as well as collaborate projects with others. 
5. GitHub  : is the website where the project can be seen online. It uses git for all the operations. So Github is a part of Git and must not be confused by Github.
